# Basic html

The following is an example for how to use Needle Engine with vanilla javascript / without using a bundler  

### How to run locally
Install [vscode live-server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).   
Then open this index.html with the live-server and navigate to ``http://localhost:5500/index.html`` in your web browser.

::: tip
Make sure to update the ``<needle-engine src="myScene.glb">`` path to an existing glb file   
or [download this sample glb](https://github.com/needle-tools/needle-engine-samples/raw/main/vanilla/myScene.glb) and put it in the same folder as the index.html, name it ``myScene.glb`` or update the src path.
