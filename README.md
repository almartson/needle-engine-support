**Needle Engine** is a web-based runtime for 3D apps. It runs on your machine for development, and can be deployed anywhere. It is flexible, extensible and has built-in support for networking and XR! 

**Needle Exporter for Unity** bridges the Unity Editor and the web runtime. It helps you to export your assets, animations, lightmaps and so on to the web. It is built around the glTF standard for 3D assets.  

**Together**, they enable incredible iteration speeds and help you to bring your content to the web.  
Some have called it the "Missing Link" between artist-friendly workflows and modern web development!
